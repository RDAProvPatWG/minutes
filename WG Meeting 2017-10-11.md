2. Review progress to date on Prov Patterns WG
	* Use Case DB
		* Review the basic pattern “Associating document metadata with graph provenance”
			* http://patterns.promsns.org/pattern/12
		* Review ideas for new patterns:
			* theory: upper ontology mappings from Simon Cox's mapping work
			* implementation: specialisation of "Associating..." for ISO19115 mapping, using GA's ISO19115 profile
			* implementation: how best to use PROV with DCAT (and other document-style metadata OWL ontologies like DC)
				* can we find a patter for this in the PROV docco?
	* Provenance Sharing workplan
3. Member reports

		* 5 provenance papers accepted now for MODSIM. Titles are:
			* Design patterns and infrastructure in a software library with efficient handling of multidimensional time series
			* Documenting provenance of science in a state government agency
			* Provenance in the next-generation spatial knowledge infrastructure
			* PROV ontology supports alignment of observational data (models)
			* Modelling causes for actions with the Decision and PROV ontologies
		* 1 poster:
			* Linking document-based metadata to provenance expressed in graphs
				* based on Pattern 12
