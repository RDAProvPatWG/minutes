  * Recommendations to DataX WG
    * What should this group recommend regarding a DCAT v2’s representation of provenance?
      * Current thought is to term a dcat:Dataset a prov:Entity (https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/128) and just “do normal PROV provenance from there”
      * I believe DCAT users will expect to see direct provenance properties, not just links to graphs
        * One example of this requirement is https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/66 - Funding Source: “Provide means to describe the funding (amount and source) of a Dataset (or entire Catalog).”
        * Another: https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/78 - Publication source with Max Dekkers writing: “The European DCAT-AP uses dct:source on Dataset referring to "the original metadata that was used in creating metadata for the Dataset"
    * What do we recommend regarding versioning?
      * https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/93 - Version subject
      * https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/92 - Version identifier
      * https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/91 - Version release date
      * https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/90 - Version definition
      * https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/89 - Version delta
